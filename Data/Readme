# Here you can find:

- The Jupyter Notebook Fl_Project3 for pulling the cryptos' prices from the Binance API, each coin at a time.
- A CSV file/coin.
- The Jupyter Notebook Fl_Project3_v2 with all prices in the same data frame and the correlation matrix between them.
- 4_coins.csv that contains prices/min of all 4 coins.

## For now all coins are quoted in relation to USDT just to have prettier numbers, but we can use "SYMBOL"/BTC too.
### There are more data points in the 4 coins.csv file in comparison to the individual csv's because the code pulls live data every minute, when you run it you'll get more too.
