## Members
- Francisco Lopez

## Description
Implement an automated statistical arbitrage trading application, where we'll trade the spread between two correlated cryptocurrencies. The objective is to profit from differences between the two prices that, statistically, are too far from each other and that under a mean reversion set up should go back to a long term equilibrium. 

## Planned Steps
1. Data sources: Binance
2. Model: https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/AvellanedaLeeStatArb071008.pdf
3. We'll estimate the parameters using scipy from python
4. Create the trading signal
5. Set up the algo-trading tool with visualization
6. Produce P&L of trading strategy.
